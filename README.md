Overall Experience:
Working on Quote it was a challenging yet engaging experience, that I feel like has helped me grow my swift capabilities. 
We experienced lots of issues, specifically when it came to syntax, as it was a new programming language that none of us were familiar with.
Regardless, our group tried to set our sights high when it came to creating an IOS app, and we found running simulations of Iphones very interesting. Overall I feel that the project has made us much more comfortable with app development, and we will likely pursue future projects.
